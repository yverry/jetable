"<li>You want to use a service on a web site that requires a confirmation "
"through email, and you know that this site will sell your address to third "
"parties; with a disposable email address, you can confirm the link that was "
"sent, yet you won't receive any advertisement that would be sent afterwards."
"</li> <li>You want to participate in a forum, and receive replies through "
"email, yet you don't want your email address to be gathered by robots. Thus "
"the robots will only get the disposable address, and after a while you won't "
"receive any more ads.</li>"
